# _Word Count_

#### By _**Yelena Nedelko**_

## Description

_The goal of the assignment was to create a website that uses a method and an argument to return how frequently a word appears in a given string. I was unable to figure out the code to return the frequency, however I did figure out how to test whether a word existing in a given string. Therefore this program simply tests whether or not the word appears in a given string and returns "true" or "false."_
